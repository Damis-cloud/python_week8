#  COVID-19 Global Data Trends Analysis

This project analyzes the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across Kenya, the United States, and India using real-world data. 
It focuses on tracking confirmed cases, deaths, and daily new infections over time to uncover meaningful trends.


# Objectives of the Project

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data.
- Analyze trends in confirmed cases and deaths over time.
- Compare daily case and death counts between selected countries.
- Visualize trends using charts to highlight key insights.
- Create a clear and shareable report/notebook summarizing findings.


# Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas – for data loading, filtering, and manipulation.
- matplotlib – for plotting time series data.
- seaborn – for enhanced statistical visualizations.


# How to Run/View the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided.
2. Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
   ```bash:
3. pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
4. Load the covid_data.csv file provided.
5. Run each cell to view data cleaning steps, exploratory analysis, and visualizations.
6. View the output charts in the /mnt/data/ folder or in your notebook output cells.

# Insights or Reflections
USA had the highest total confirmed cases and deaths among the three countries analyzed.

India showed a sharp increase in cases during certain periods but with a lower death rate.

Kenya maintained relatively lower case numbers but trends aligned with global waves.

The absence of vaccination data in the dataset limited the analysis on vaccine rollout progress.

Visualizing daily and cumulative trends is powerful in understanding the pandemic's global impact and regional differences.
